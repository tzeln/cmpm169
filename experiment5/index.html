				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In this project, I wanted to imitate one of the examples shown in class that represented a permanently moving isometric cityscape. I prompted ChatGPT to generate me an isometric cityscape and was given a mediocre result. 
					Although not the best, it was a start. However, there wasn’t any actual use of 3D functions in this program and I was having trouble trying to create a permutation of this that would actually result in something cool, so I switched to something different. I searched for the type of result I wanted and ended up following a YouTube tutorial, but the result is very impressive. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After copying this result, I brainstormed a couple ways I could make this somewhat of an original idea. I came up with a couple things:
					<ul>
						<li>audio visualizer, I just need to map the height of the boxes to audio somehow</li>
						<li>something that interacts on top of the waves like a rolling sphere; it won’t ever fall off the edges</li>
						<li>randomly generate a maze by setting box height to h*0.2 in a connected line that randomly twists from end-to-end; have a rolling sphere roll through the maze based on the waviness of the structure (I’d have to implement physics somehow)
							mouse interactivity (have the boxes rise whenever the cursor is above them)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Some of these ideas seemed very difficult (the maze one specifically), so I chose the mouse interactive idea first. I took some time to really understand the code, but I attempted to do this without AI help (it turned out to be very simple, I just mapped h to correspond with mouseY). I personally think it’s very cool. </p>		
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Although I successfully mapped the cubes to rise with mouse location, I wanted a little bit more user interaction. I decided to map the entire piece to mouseX and mouseY to see how that would work. Along with some alterations to the RGB specifications, canvas proportions, and translation functions, you can see the final result below.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Honestly, I feel like I've been carried by the YouTube tutorial I followed. Although it matches pretty closely to what I had originally envisioned, a lot of the heavy work was done by the tutorial rather than my own efforts. I will, however, credit myself with taking the time to understand line-by-line what the code did so I could make my own iterations upon it. I put in a moderate amount of effort to achieve this, but I have no doubt a better understanding of code and math would have yielded a better result.</p>
