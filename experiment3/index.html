			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I’m aiming to make a cool variation of ripples via mouse input and some generative method. I prompted ChatGPT for something basic but after finding out that ChatGPT basically did everything for me, I had to put in custom edits into the background and add some color changing to the ripples themselves.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After finding this imitation relatively successful, I’m aiming for doing something a little larger and more immersive. I expanded the canvas and altered some of the ripple speeds/radius/etc. The main goal is to make it less of a mouse trigger and more of ripples naturally occurring on the screen. I had a couple iterations where I tried making ripple patterns in specific shapes, but I ended up settling on ripples in a circle. I tried positioning them artistically around the canvas, though my current result leaves a little more to be desired.</p>
				<p>This was super cool but it almost kills my laptop so I don’t think it’s very friendly to most machines. To fix this, I reduced the canvas size (back to the original size) to decrease lag and played around with the patterns to optimize it more to my liking. What I’m trying to do is get another circle of ripples around the center (or just another recognizable pattern really). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I’m not really confident in my math because it has been a very long time, so I’ve mainly just been toying around with the numbers I believe have correlation and going from there.Because I managed to fix the lag issue, I re-increased the canvas size and I’ve been playing around with orientations and ways to implement ripples in different ways. I actually like adding random ripples (on top of the existing pattern) the most because I like how it seems that within the chaos of random ripples, there exists some higher complexity or pattern.</p>
				<p>After figuring all of this out, I felt that the user input being able to create extra ripples was just a little redundant. It didn’t really match the vision of the current piece and I wanted to change that. I came up with the conclusion to make the user’s input reverse the pattern (in some way). Realistically, this meant reversing the alpha value of the new ripples being pushed via user-input. On paper though, there aren’t any visible ripples from the user, the pattern just disappears the more the user tries to click on the screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I struggled less in this experiment than the one previously for sure. Unfortunately, though, I feel like I was so locked into the type of piece I wanted to create (I wanted to make ripples that serve as some cool, abstract metaphor of the garden of forking paths), I sort of locked myself out of the other possibilities for later in the project. I couldn’t really think of more things to do after my piece reached a certain point because it was basically what I had wanted in the first place. However, I’m happy with how it turned out so I guess that’s what matters.</p>
