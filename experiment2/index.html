				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Because I’m unfamiliar with both JS and p5, I started with very simple imitations to get a general understanding of how to work around the language and library. The first imitation that I attempted was a simple cube rotation example from the reference page. This was too simple, however (the code is already given on the page), so I wanted to learn how I could implement multiple of these boxes all spinning at the same time. I utilized a lot of ChatGPT and edited some variables to get a more desired result, but you can see the result here. After this result, I wanted to recode it myself (without as much assistance from ChatGPT) so I could gauge how much I learnt – which was a general success.

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After remaking the cubes with less redundant code, I wanted to use my increased understanding of what was going on to try and add some cool gradients to the cubes.I wanted a more smooth gradient but I think it would be incredibly hard to identify the color bounds for each cube unless I made a separate class and did some math I don’t know to keep the pattern consistent. So instead, I just increased the amount of cubes to make the gradient smoother. </p>
				<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to work out as intended, so I did some research into the map function to see how I could make the RGB gamer lights more immersive. I think I understand it but I kept getting random white diagonal lines of cubes that interrupted the gradient and I couldn’t figure out why, so maybe I understood less than I thought. After toying with enough numbers though, I managed to get a satisfactory result.

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Although I’m actually pretty satisfied with what I have now, I wanted to see if I could maybe add some mouse control or user-input into the graphic to make it more immersive. I prompted ChatGPT to implement mouse control over the cubes’ angle and was given a pretty good solution to do so. I just needed to put the code generated into a different loop and my cubes were rotating according to mouse location (as well as by themselves cos I think it’s cool). Additionally, I wanted to alter the rotation for the cubes so I implemented a for-loop into the rotation aspect to create a more pendulum-like swing, the final result can be viewed below.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, this project was mostly me just learning JS and exploring the p5 library. The work I've made is probably a little underwhelming but any ideas I have to make this better are quite out of scope when considering my coding abilities and math understanding.</p>
