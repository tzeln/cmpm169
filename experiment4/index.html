			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I wanted to imitate some image alteration techniques seen on the Generative Design website. I’m a big fan of this celebrity cat named uni, and I want to do some interesting gradient or pattern effects on him This unfortunately is more than a little laggy for even my PC, so I attempted some ways to minimize this. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>While my allegiance to uni is insurmountable, I cannot say that the piece so far flatters him besides his silhouette. To fix this, I aim to increase the contrast between values within his body (or at least his face) to make the initial read a little more clear. One thing I attempted to increase this was decreasing the size of boxes that are replaced by the colon three. This result was pretty scary though, and I noticed that 
				some of the ‘:3’ become so large that the fact this image has been made from them is seemingly lost until closer observation due to their overlap. Another thing that became obvious is that this function reverses grayscale. Uni’s body should be more black here rather than his surroundings. I realized that the function I prompted from ChatGPT was flawed and integrated the grayscale conversion function from this Generative Design piece to achieve a significantly better result.</p>
