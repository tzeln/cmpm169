			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In this project, I want to create some art out of L-systems. I was interested in the examples displayed during class, but I don’t have anything I particularly want to replicate. I aim to make something basic in this section. I used ChatGPT to generate a basic structure for an L-system and then created my own rules. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The goal here is to integrate different techniques I see from other works to create a more graphic looking result. After prompting ChatGPT and sifting through some different references, I simplified my turtle function and made a more cohesive line pattern. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The result I have so far looks decent, but I want to see if I can make something that’s a bit more broad. Although I’m not really sure how I aim to achieve this, I think the best solution is to alter the L-system rules to configure the patterns into something a little more concrete. Either that or increase the sample axiom to be something much larger. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was a little clueless at the start of this assignment. I actually had attempted something else at the beginning with some font imports and I wanted to create an interesting effect with user-input text, but I couldn’t really figure out how to achieve this without significantly copying other Generative Design examples’ structural code. I settled with L-systems and it was honestly pretty simple how quickly it worked out. </p>
